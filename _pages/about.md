I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Intelligent Science and Technology at the College of Artificial Intelligence, [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/), located in Tianjin, China. I have been a research student in [AI4CE LAB](https://ai4ce.github.io/) at New York University(NYU), working with [Dr.Yiming Li](https://yimingli-page.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng) since Mar.2024.

My research interests focus on computer vision, machine learning, and their applications in robotics, with an emphasis on designing intelligent systems capable of perceiving and interacting with complex environments with minimal human intervention. This work aims to contribute to the advancement of robotics and embodied AI in the future. Specifically, I focus on techniques such as neural rendering and diffusion models.

Outside of research, I enjoy traveling and various sports, such as jogging and skiing.
